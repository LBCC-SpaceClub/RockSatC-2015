RockSat-C
=========

Software for Linn-Benton Community College's [2015 RockSat-C project](http://spacegrant.colorado.edu/current-teams/lbcc15)

[RockSat-C](http://spacegrant.colorado.edu/national-programs/rs-c-2015-home) is an annual program in which students build and launch a scientific payload on board a sounding rocket from NASA's [Wallops Flight Facility](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/wallops/home/) in Virginia.  The Colorado Space Grant Consortium manages the project and keeps students on track by requiring them to present defend their experiment designs through a series of presentations throughout the year.  Each summer, accepted students fly out to Wallops for a final round of physical testing before launch.

This repo holds the code and some data analysis from the LBCC team's flight in the summer of 2015.
